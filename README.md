This is my final project for Introduction to Deep Learning as part of academic credit. Given a series of MRI scans, identify and classify any brain tumors Gliomas, a type of brain tumor, are the most common primary brain tumors in adults
our task is to take a series of magnetic resonant images or mris and identify and  classify any brain tumors. For this, we developed attention-swin-UNETR. The Swin U-Net architecture, also known as Swin-Transformer U-Net, is a variant of the U-Net architecture that incorporates the Swin Transformer into the traditional U-Net architecture and CNN as decoder. It has shown promising results in various medical image analysis tasks, including segmentation , due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies and spatial relationships in images. The Swin Transformer is organized into multiple stages, with each stage processing the input data at a different spatial resolution. It starts by partitioniong the input into non-overlapping patches. These patches are processed hierarchically through a series of stages, each consisting of transformer layers.I t uses cross-window and shifted attention mechanisms to enable effective information exchange between neighboring patches. This helps improve feature representation and facilitates long-range dependencies. The decoder consists of residual block with 2 convolution layers.
